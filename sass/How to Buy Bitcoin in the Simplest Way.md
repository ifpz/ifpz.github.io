## Bitcoin Price History and Market Trends  

### 2020â€“2024: A Rollercoaster of Growth  
Bitcoinâ€™s journey from $26,500 in December 2020 to $62,600 by February 2024 highlights its volatility and potential. Key milestones include:  

| **Date**          | **Price (USD)** | **Key Events**                              |  
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Dec 2020           | $26,500         | Surge in institutional adoption             |  
| Nov 2021           | $60,000         | ETF approvals and El Salvadorâ€™s adoption    |  
| Feb 2024           | $62,600         | Global economic uncertainty boosts demand   |  

**Why Bitcoin Keeps Rising**  
- **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million BTC exist, creating scarcity.  
- **Institutional Interest**: Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy are buying in bulk.  
- **Macroeconomic Factors**: Inflation fears and geopolitical tensions drive investors to decentralized assets.  

### Lessons from Past Volatility  
Bitcoinâ€™s price has swung dramatically over the years, offering both opportunities and risks. For example:  
- **2021 Corrections**: After hitting $64,000 in April 2021, it dropped to $30,000 by July due to regulatory crackdowns in China.  
- **2024 Resilience**: Despite interest rate hikes, BTC rebounded to $62,600, signaling strong market confidence.  

**Key Takeaway**: Timing the market is risky, but long-term holding (HODLing) has historically rewarded investors.
