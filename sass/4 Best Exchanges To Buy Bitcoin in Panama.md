#### 2. Complete KYC Verification

Most platforms approve standard verifications instantly, with complex cases taking up to 48 hours.

#### 3. Deposit Fiat Currency

After account verification, link your preferred payment method:

|----------------|-------------------------|------|  
| Credit/Debit Card | Instant | 1.5-3% |  
| Bank Transfer (SEPA) | 1-5 business days | 0-1.5% |  
| SWIFT Transfer | 2-5 business days | $10-20 |  

#### 4. Execute Your Bitcoin Purchase

Modern exchanges allow fractional Bitcoin purchases, with minimum transaction amounts typically starting at $10-20 USD equivalent. Advanced traders can utilize limit orders and market analysis tools for strategic investments.

#### 5. Secure Your Assets in Cold Storage

While exchange wallets offer convenience, hardware wallets provide optimal security through offline storage. Consider transferring significant holdings to cold storage solutions within 24 hours of purchase.
