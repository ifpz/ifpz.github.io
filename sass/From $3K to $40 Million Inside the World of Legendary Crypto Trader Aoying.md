## Early Career and Breakthrough

### Transition from Internet Product Management to Crypto Trading

Aoying's journey began in 2020 when their work in internet product management intersected with blockchain technology. With an initial trading budget of $3,000-$5,000 USD per month, they navigated the volatile crypto markets while maintaining a full-time job. The breakthrough came through OKX's copy-trading feature, where the "all in crypto" signal achieved 300% returns with minimal drawdowns, attracting the first wave of followers.

### Learning Through Real-World Observation

Unlike traditional traders who study technical indicators systematically, Aoying developed their skills by analyzing real-time trades from successful traders. This observational learning approach included:

- Joining trader communities
- Studying execution patterns
- Understanding profit/loss rationales
- Combining practical experience with mentorship

This methodology emphasizes practical experience over theoretical learning, a philosophy that continues to shape Aoying's trading approach.

## Psychological Breakthroughs and Risk Management

### Overcoming the "200K Curse"

A critical phase in Aoying's career involved repeated failures reaching $200,000 account value. This pattern broke during 2024's AI and memecoin boom cycles, where strategic positioning captured three major market moves:

1. Bitcoin Ordinals resurgence
2. AI token rally
3. Memecoin explosion

This experience highlights the importance of psychological preparedness over technical analysis at critical capital thresholds.

### Key Risk Management Evolution

| Stage | Leverage Used | Risk Control Method |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Early Days | 5-10x | Emotional trading |
| Transition | 3-5x | Manual stop-loss |
| Professional | 0.5-2x | Position sizing & event analysis |

The transformation from impulsive trading to disciplined risk management marked a pivotal turning point in Aoying's career.

## Trading Philosophy and Market Analysis

### Event-Driven Trading Strategy

Aoying's methodology emphasizes fundamental event analysis over technical indicators. Key components include:

- Monitoring geopolitical developments (e.g., Trump-Musk controversies)
- Tracking macroeconomic data
- Assessing project-specific news
- Understanding market psychology patterns

This approach proved successful in several high-profile trades, including the $1.4 million DOGE short during the Tesla stock decline.

### Technical Approach Evolution

While initially experimenting with various technical systems (double MA, Fibonacci, Elliott Wave), Aoying now focuses on:

- Price action analysis
- Volume patterns
- Market structure assessment
- Historical precedent comparison

The trader emphasizes that while indicators provide context, true profits come from understanding market dynamics.

## Practical Trading Framework

### Position Sizing and Leverage Strategy

Aoying's approach to position sizing follows these principles:

1. **Initial Phase**: Use minimum leverage (0.5-1x) for learning
2. **Growth Phase**: Gradual increase to 2-3x with proven strategies
3. **Professional Phase**: Leverage reduction as capital grows

This counterintuitive approach of reducing leverage with increased capital protects against catastrophic losses while maintaining growth potential.

| Breakout | Volume surge, price penetration | Follow-through entry |
| Reversal | Divergence, momentum shift | Contrarian positioning |
