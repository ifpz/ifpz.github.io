## Understanding MetaMask and Its Token Compatibility

MetaMask functions as a non-custodial wallet that supports **Ethereum (ETH)** and **ERC-20 tokens**â€”the most common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, it accommodates **ERC-721 tokens**, which power non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This versatility makes MetaMask a preferred choice for users interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Web3 applications.

### Key Features of MetaMask:
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Available as a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox) and mobile app (iOS/Android).
- **Security**: Private keys are stored locally, ensuring users maintain full control over their assets.
- **Network Flexibility**: Supports Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and custom networks like Binance Smart Chain.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Tokens

### 1. Setting Up Your MetaMask Wallet
Before adding tokens, ensure your wallet is properly configured:
1. Install the **MetaMask browser extension** via the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
2. Create a new wallet or import an existing one using your recovery phrase.
3. Secure your wallet with a strong password and store recovery phrases in a safe location.

### 2. Adding Standard ERC-20 Tokens
MetaMask automatically detects popular tokens, but manual addition may be required for less common assets:
1. Open MetaMask and navigate to the **"Assets" tab**.
2. Click **"Import Tokens"** at the bottom of the page.
3. Use the search bar to locate your token by name or symbol (e.g., USDT, DAI).
4. Select the token and click **"Next"**, then confirm the import.

### 3. Swapping Tokens Within MetaMask
MetaMask's built-in swap feature enables direct trading between compatible tokens:
1. Go to the **"Swap" tab** in your wallet.
2. Choose the token you want to swap and select the desired output token.
3. Review the exchange rate and transaction fees, then click **"Swap"** to execute the trade.

### 4. Importing Custom Tokens
For tokens not listed in MetaMask's database:
1. Navigate to **"Import Tokens" > "Custom Token"**.
2. Enter the **token contract address** (obtainable from Etherscan or exchanges).
3. Input the token symbol and decimals (usually 18 for ERC-20 tokens).
4. Click **"Add Custom Token"** to finalize the process.

## Best Practices for Token Management

### Verifying Token Addresses
Always cross-check contract addresses on trusted platforms like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokens) to avoid phishing scams. For example:
- **Tether (USDT)**: `0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7`
- **DAI Stablecoin**: `0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F`

### Managing Gas Fees
Token transfers and swaps require gas fees paid in ETH. Monitor network congestion using tools like [GasNow](https://www.gasnow.org/) to optimize transaction costs.

### Securing Your Wallet
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security.
- Avoid sharing your recovery phrase or private keys.
- Regularly update MetaMask to the latest version for bug fixes and features.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Token Not Showing Up
If a token fails to appear after import:
1. Double-check the contract address for typos.
2. Ensure the network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet) matches the token's blockchain.
3. Refresh the MetaMask interface or restart the browser.

### High Transaction Fees
Gas fees fluctuate based on network demand. Consider:
- Using **layer-2 solutions** like Polygon for cheaper transactions.
- Scheduling transfers during off-peak hours.

### Failed Transactions
Failed swaps or transfers often result from:
- Insufficient ETH for gas fees.
- Incorrect token addresses.
- Network congestion delays.

## Advanced Tips for Power Users

### Multi-Token Management
Organize your portfolio by:
- Creating **custom labels** for tokens (e.g., "Stablecoins," "DeFi").
- Hiding unused tokens via the **three-dot menu** in the "Assets" tab.

### Connecting to dApps
MetaMask seamlessly integrates with platforms like Uniswap, Aave, and OpenSea:
1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** on the dApp interface.
2. Approve the connection through MetaMask.

### Exploring Alternative Networks
Add networks like Binance Smart Chain or Avalanche for broader token support:
1. Go to **Settings > Networks > Add Network**.
2. Input network details (RPC URL, chain ID, etc.).
