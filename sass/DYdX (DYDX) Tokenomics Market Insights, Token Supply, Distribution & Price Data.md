## DYDX Tokenomics: Core Metrics Explained  

### Total Supply vs. Circulating Supply  
- **Total Supply**: The total number of DYDX tokens that exist or will ever exist.  
- **Circulating Supply**: The number of tokens actively available in the market.  

For DYDX, the circulating supply (900.92M) reflects the tokens currently accessible to users. This metric influences liquidity and market dynamics.  

### Max Supply and Inflation Rate  
- **Max Supply**: The absolute upper limit of DYDX tokens.  
- **Inflation Rate**: Measures how new tokens enter circulation, impacting scarcity and long-term value.  

A limited max supply combined with a low inflation rate could drive **long-term price appreciation** by reducing token dilution.  

### Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)  
FDV estimates DYDX's total market cap if all tokens were in circulation. Itâ€™s calculated as:  
**Current Price Ã— Max Supply**. A high FDV relative to the current market cap might signal overvaluation risks.

   A large circulating supply (900.92M) ensures smoother trading with minimal slippage.  

2. **Scarcity and Price Potential**  
   Limited max supply and low inflation could boost DYDX's value over time by maintaining scarcity.  

3. **Transparent Distribution = Trust**  
   Clear token allocation reduces risks of centralized control and enhances investor confidence.  

4. **FDV as a Valuation Tool**  
   Traders use FDV to compare DYDXâ€™s potential growth against its current market cap.
