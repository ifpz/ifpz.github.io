# Helium Price: HNT Price and Market Charts

Helium's current market price stands at **$2.23 per HNT**, with a 24-hour trading volume of **$9.31 million**. Over the last 24 hours, HNT has maintained price stability with **0.00% change**, while circulating supply reaches **184.5 million HNT** against a maximum supply cap of **223 million HNT**. This decentralized wireless network token continues to attract attention for its unique blockchain-powered IoT infrastructure.

## What Is Helium?

Helium represents a groundbreaking **decentralized wireless network** designed specifically for low-power IoT (Internet of Things) devices. By leveraging specialized hardware called **Hotspots**, this network enables seamless data transmission between smart devices and the internet. Participants earn **HNT cryptocurrency** rewards for contributing network coverage and relaying data through their Hotspots.

### Key Features:
- **Hybrid blockchain-node architecture**
- **LongFi wireless protocol** for long-range, low-power connectivity
- **Proof of Coverage (PoC)** consensus mechanism
- **Dual-token economy** with Data Credits (DCs)

## The Evolution of Helium

Founded in 2013 by **Shawn Fanning, Amir Haleem, and Sean Carey**, Helium emerged from the realization that traditional wireless networks couldn't meet future IoT demands. The team developed **Helium Hotspots** - physical blockchain nodes that combine wireless gateway functionality with cryptocurrency rewards.

### Major Milestones:
| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2021 | Monthly HNT issuance halved to 2.5M |
| 2021 | Network surpasses 100,000 active nodes |
| 2021 | $111 million raised through token sale |
| 2023 | Strategic partnership with Invoxia for GPS tracking integration |

## How Helium Works

Helium's innovative **Proof of Coverage (PoC)** mechanism validates wireless coverage through cryptographic challenges. Miners (Hotspot operators) earn HNT rewards by:
1. **Providing network coverage**
2. **Relaying sensor data**
3. **Participating in coverage proofs**

### Network Mechanics:
1. **Hotspots transmit radio waves**
2. **Coverage challenges initiated via blockchain**
3. **Cryptographic verification of location validity**
4. **Reward distribution based on coverage quality**

This decentralized approach creates a **self-sustaining wireless ecosystem** where participants directly contribute to network expansion while earning cryptocurrency rewards.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Helium differ from traditional wireless networks?**  
A: Unlike centralized networks, Helium's blockchain-based infrastructure rewards community participants for building and maintaining coverage. This decentralized model eliminates traditional telecom infrastructure costs while creating economic incentives for network growth.

**Q: What devices can connect to the Helium network?**  
A: Any device supporting the **LongFi protocol** can join the network. This includes environmental sensors, asset trackers, smart agriculture devices, and other battery-powered IoT equipment requiring long-range connectivity.

## HNT Token Utility

HNT serves two primary functions within the Helium ecosystem:

### 1. Network Participation Rewards
Hotspot operators earn HNT for:
- Providing wireless coverage
- Relaying data packets
- Participating in network validation

### 2. Data Credit Generation
Users burn HNT to create **Data Credits (DCs)** - the network's transaction fee currency. This deflationary mechanism maintains token value while funding network security.

| Token Function | Purpose | Economic Impact |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| Mining Rewards | Incentivize coverage | Supply distribution |
| Data Credits | Transaction fees | Deflationary pressure |
| Staking Mechanism | Network security | Liquidity control |
