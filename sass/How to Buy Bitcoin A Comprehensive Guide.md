2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Marketplaces**  
3. **Bitcoin ATMs**

## Buying Bitcoin via P2P Platforms  

P2P marketplaces like **LocalBitcoins** or **OKXâ€™s C2C section** allow direct transactions between users. This method offers flexibility in payment methods (bank transfers, gift cards, etc.) but requires caution:  

- **Verify Seller Reputation**: Check transaction history, ratings, and response time.  
- **Use Escrow Services**: Platforms like OKX hold Bitcoin until payment is confirmed, reducing fraud risk.
