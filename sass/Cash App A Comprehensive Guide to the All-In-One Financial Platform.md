## Company Overview

### Founders and Vision

Cash App's journey began with the partnership between Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey, two visionaries who recognized the limitations of traditional payment systems. McKelvey's experience with a lost $2,000 glass faucet sale due to high credit card fees inspired the creation of Square's first payment reader. This innovative approach to financial technology eventually led to the development of Cash App, which now serves as a cornerstone of Square's financial services ecosystem.
