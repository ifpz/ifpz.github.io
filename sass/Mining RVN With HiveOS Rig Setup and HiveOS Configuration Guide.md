## Setting Up Your Mining Rig for RVN  
### Hardware Requirements  
A competitive RVN mining setup requires:  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super or better; older 6GB cards like the P106-100 work but with lower hashrates.  
- **Motherboard**: Supports multiple GPUs with PCIe x1 slots.  
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB DDR4.  
- **PSU**: 600W+ power supply with sufficient PCIe connectors.  
- **Cooling**: Proper airflow to sustain performance under heavy load.  

### HiveOS Installation Basics  
1. **Download HiveOS**: Use the official website to create a bootable USB drive.  
2. **BIOS Settings**: Enable PCIe Gen3 and adjust power-saving features.  
3. **Worker Configuration**: Assign a unique worker name in the HiveOS dashboard for easy monitoring.  

**Pro Tip**: Use the HiveOS web interface to track temps, fan speeds, and hashrate in real time.

## Optimizing HiveOS for RVN Mining  
### Overclocking and Undervolting Settings  
Balancing hashrate and power consumption is critical. For NVIDIA cards:  
- **Core Clock**: +100 to +150 MHz  
- **Memory Clock**: +500 to +700 MHz  
- **Power Target**: 75-85% to reduce energy use  

Test settings incrementally to avoid instability.  

### Mining Software Configuration  
HiveOS supports multiple miners, but **TeamRedMiner** and **Kaspa Miner** are recommended for KawPow. Configure via the web interface:  
1. Select "Mining" > "Profiles" > "Add New Profile."  
2. Set the algorithm to `kawpow`.  
3. Input pool details (e.g., 2Miners or ProHashing).  

**FAQ**:  
**Q: What pool should I use for RVN mining?**  
A: 2Miners offers low fees and reliable uptime, ideal for beginners.

## Profitability Analysis for RVN Mining  
### Factors Impacting Earnings  
1. **Hashrate**: Higher hashrate = more blocks mined.  
2. **Electricity Costs**: Aim for <$0.12/kWh for profitability.  
3. **RVN Price Volatility**: Market fluctuations directly affect USD earnings.  

### Example Calculation  
| Hardware        | Hashrate | Power Consumption | Daily Earnings (RVN) |  
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|  
| 6x RX 6700 XT   | 180 MH/s | 1,200W             | ~12 RVN ($3.60)      |  

**Note**: Use calculators like [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) for real-time projections.  

**FAQ**:  
**Q: Is RVN mining profitable in 2025?**  
A: Yes for miners with low electricity costs (<$0.10/kWh) and modern GPUs.
